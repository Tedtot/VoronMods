# XY MGN12 Sheet Metal Conversion for Monolith

## Information
Currently there are no good XY joints for MGN12 rails on Y. This is mainly due to the tight belt path, resulting in very little clearance for proper mounting.

I hope to solve that with this mod.

This design is based off [CloakedWayne](https://github.com/CloakedWayne)'s design. Wayne is currently developing SLM XY joints, but I want to try to implement the joints with sheet metal instead.

## DISCLAIMER
This mod is constantly *subject to change*.

There is travel loss with MGN12 rails on the Y axis.

CAD files will not be released unless performance is proven.
