# CNC Inserts for Carbonara CF Tube

## Information
This mod replaces the plastic inserts used to help with compressive load and torsional rigidity. The goal is to take advantage of the properties of metal to reduce weight (by a small amount) and increase theoretical strength.

Realistically the gain is very small. For a 300mm build, the weight reduction using SirayaTech PET-CF as a baseline is only around 12g (assuming solid inserts or 6+ walls).

For people chasing the last few bits of performance or have access to a CNC, go right ahead.

## Weight
End pieces and all inserts only - no hardware.

Material reference: aluminum 6061-t6.
- **250mm**: 21.06g
- **300mm**: 23.21g
- **350mm**: 25.35g

SirayaTech PET-CF reference for a 300mm build: 34.64g

## DISCLAIMER
This design is only compatible with [Brazuka](https://github.com/Brazuka-1)'s Carbonara CF Tube.

CAD files will not be released unless performance is proven.
